You will need the following files in your path (or modify MediaOS.psm1 appropriately):

x264
x265
mkvinfo
mkvpropedit
mkvmerge
mkvextract
MediaInfo_cli (Windows)/mediainfo (Linux)
ffmpeg
ffprobe
dovi_tool

You will also need to modify the encode, tmp and mux dirs in the MediaOS script.

MediaOS and MediaInfo go into the Powershell modules folder.

You may or may not want to run RetitleMKV.ps1 (last step in the encode script).
Also, this is currently set up how I rename files, with info about the crf, noise supression, 
and dolby vision as part of the name.

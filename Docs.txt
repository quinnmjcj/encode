You will need the following files in your path (or modify MediaOS.psm1 appropriately):

x264
x265
mkvinfo
mkvpropedit
mkvmerge
mkvextract
MediaInfo_cli (Windows)/mediainfo (Linux)
ffmpeg
ffprobe
dovi_tool

You will also need to modify the encode, tmp and mux dirs in the MediaOS script.

MediaOS and MediaInfo go into the Powershell modules folder.

You may or may not want to run RetitleMKV.ps1 (last step in the encode script).
Also, this is currently set up how I rename files, with info about the crf, noise supression, 
and dolby vision as part of the name.

Mel and Fel dolby vision are done using dovi_tool.  I don't know for 100% certain that 
Fel dolby vision will play properly with a player that can play the full 12-bit video (I use NVidia shield, which
only plays the Mel parts of the dolby vision).  However, I am using a method borrowed from
BD Rebuilder (https://www.videohelp.com/software/BD-Rebuilder), which is to create a chapter file 
to force all the I-frames in the encoded video to align with the I-frames in the FEL layer.  This is
what BD-Rebuilder does when it downsamples a blu-ray.  The only difference is that it keeps the 2 layers as separate
video streams, because that's what a blu-ray wants, whereas this script creates a 07.06 EL_RPU that is muxed with the
newly encoded video.
